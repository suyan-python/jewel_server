            Since the 1980s, coffee growing in Nepal has proved effective in
            preventing natural disasters such as landslides and floods. We only
            use organic fertilizers and encourage a bird-friendly environment by
            planting shade trees, which also improve air quality. Medulla trees
            grow in this eastern, hilly part of Nepal. Medulla is the Nepali
            name for Tephrosia candida, a legume shade tree used for
            agroforestry and coffee establishment to support nitrogen-fixing. It
            is a fast-growing and drought-tolerant shade tree that retains
            moisture through its fallen leaves. We will also plant avocado and
            pineapple for shade and an extra income source. We encourage our
            farmers to intercrop and use resources that would otherwise go
            unused by a single crop. For now, farmers mostly grow turmeric and
            ginger alongside coffee. They plant a common ginger that is a staple
            used in cooking curry every day in every Nepali kitchen. This
            variety is also used to treat muscle pain, nausea, indigestion, cold
            and flu, and inflammation. Turmericâ€™s bright orange flesh turns a
            distinct shade of yellow when dried or boiled. It contains very rich
            antioxidant properties and is used every day. Farmers also grow
            spinach, mustard, chillies, and radish to eat themselves.
