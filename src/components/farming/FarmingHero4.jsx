                We only use organic fertilizers and encourage a bird-friendly
                environment by planting shade trees, which also improve air
                quality. Medulla trees grow in this eastern, hilly part of
                Nepal. Medulla is the Nepali name for Tephrosia candida, a
                legume shade tree used for agroforestry and coffee establishment
                to support nitrogen-fixing.

                    It is a fast-growing and drought-tolerant shade tree that
                    retains moisture through its fallen leaves. We will also
                    plant avocado and pineapple for shade and an extra income
                    source. We encourage our farmers to intercrop and use
                    resources that would otherwise go unused by a single crop.
                    For now, farmers mostly grow turmeric and ginger alongside
                    coffee. They plant a common ginger that is a staple used in
                    cooking curry every day in every Nepali kitchen. This
                    variety is also used to treat muscle pain, nausea,
                    indigestion, cold and flu, and inflammation. Turmericâ€™s
                    bright orange flesh turns a distinct shade of yellow when
                    dried or boiled. It contains very rich antioxidant
                    properties and is used every day. Farmers also grow spinach,
                    mustard, chillies, and radish to eat themselves.
