            called Puwamai. The Puwa river flows year-long bringing water
            directly from the mountains to our coffee plants in the farm and
            nursery. The local village, Futuk, is in the foothills of Mt
            Kanchenjunga surrounded by pristine landscape and thick natural
            forests. Our coffee fields sit on a bend of the river. It is a
            beautiful district with breathtaking views of rivers, streams,
            flowers, birds, and dense natural forests. Treasured cultural sites
            abound, surrounded by the backdrop of stunning mountains.

            There are many bird species in the forests and coffee shade trees.
            We are keen to share knowledge of local birds and this extraordinary
            land with tourists as part of our business operations. We have a
            glorious subtropical climate with lovely weather throughout the
            year. The monsoon rains turn the countryside green and full of
            bloom, enriching our coffee for harvest in February. Coffee workers
            come from different religions with most of them Hindus. Women coffee
            farmers typically wear dhoti cholo and saris, and men wear dhaka
            topi and daura suruwal, which are our national clothes.
